# 🚀 Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project showcases my **data visualization** and **business intelligence** skills using **Power BI**. I have built a comprehensive and interactive sales dashboard using the `Sales Dataset.xlsx` to help analyze trends in sales and profitability across product categories, customer segments, years, and countries.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

## 🔍 Dashboard Visualizations & Insights

The report is structured into four key sections to provide a holistic view of the sales performance:

### 1. Total Sales by Category and Segment
A stacked horizontal bar chart visualizes the total sales for each primary product category (**Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture**) broken down by the customer segment (**Consumer, Corporate, Home Office**).

> *Insight: Technology and Office Supplies generate the highest sales figures across all segments.*

### 2. Total Sales and Profit Over Time
A dual-axis line chart tracks the annual trends in **Sales** and **Profit** from **2011 to 2014**, demonstrating consistent upward growth over the period.

### 3. Profit by Country
An interactive **map visual** highlights the country-wise profit distribution across **Europe**, allowing for quick identification of top-performing regions.

### 4. Best-Selling Products
A **Treemap** visualization highlights the performance of individual products. The size of each block represents the magnitude of the sales or profit generated by the product.

> *Example: The Treemap identifies "Nokia Smart Phone, Full Size" and "Cisco Smart Phone..." as the top-selling products.*
